## Research

We study:
- Visual cognition with a focus on (natural) dynamic vision
- Brain rhythms and their role in attention and multisensory perception
- Human performance: predicting lapses of attention under high task demands

We use the following methods:
- Electro-/Magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG)
- Eye tracking for pupillometry
- functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
- Other physiological measures (respiration, pulse rate)

Studies take place in lab-based and mobile 'real-world' environments.
